# IM2CAD

It's a repository trying to achieve the idea in paper <a href = "https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~izadinia/im2cad.html">IM2CAD</a>. The main goal of this paper is to reconstruct a scene that is similar to the given photo of a room.

## Preparation

- <a href = "http://tigress-web.princeton.edu/~fy/lsun/public/release/">LSUN</a> is needed in pixel-level labeling task to estimate the room geometry.

- <a href = "http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/nonpub-downloads">imagenet2012</a> dataset is used to detect the objects in the room(pre-trained model was used in the paper).

- <a href = "https://www.shapenet.org/">ShapeNet</a> 3D models are the objects will appear in the reconstructed scene.

## Networks

- Fully concolutional networks.
- Faster-RCNN.

## Process
